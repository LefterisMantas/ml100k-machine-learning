## Genetic Algorithm Implementation for Movie Recommendation System


This project is implemented in Python programming language and uses libraries such as
#### DEAP (https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/), 
#### Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) and
#### Sci-Kit Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) metrics

In this project a genetic algorithm was created for predicting the missing values in the data set (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

Users have already graded movies and by this knowledge we are trying to infer their gradings for the rest of the movies in the set.

The best settings and genetic operators were used to train the algorithm to predict better and with the nimimum possible error.

More explanations and results can be found in the Report.
